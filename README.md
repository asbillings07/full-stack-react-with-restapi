# Full Stack React App With REST API

## About This Project

Welcome to the Student Courses App. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, users can create an account and sign in to create, update or delete courses they own.

## Motivation and Lessons learned

- Motivation:

  - This project was created as the final project in the Treehouse TechDegree program.

- Lessons Learned
  - Using JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for your application in a modular fashion
  - Using React Router to set up routes
  - Using the Fetch API and Axios to fetch data from my REST API I created.
  - Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
  - REST API design
  - Node.js, and Express to create API routes
  - Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence
  - Using Postman for testing and exploring my REST API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts and Project Use

In the API directory you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the REST API on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

In the Client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
